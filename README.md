# City17

City17 is a half-project, half-experiment that combines various aspects of Rust development into a single, cohesive example. It integrates popular crates, explores different project types-including web applications and CLI tools-and demonstrates techniques for instrumentation, testing, and overall project structure. Designed as a practical reference, City17 serves as a consolidated blueprint for Rust programming concepts and provides insight into different approaches within the ecosystem.
